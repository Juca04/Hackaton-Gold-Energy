# ⚡ Goldenergy XP - Gamified Energy Dashboard

**Goldenergy XP** is a mobile-first web application developed during the 6:30-hour **Goldenergy Hackathon** at JEI 2026 (UTAD). 

The goal of this project is to incentivize sustainable habits and energy savings through gamification. By completing monthly challenges and reducing their energy consumption, users earn XP, level up, and unlock real-world discounts on their energy invoices.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Gamification System:** Users progress through tiers (from *Faísca Verde* to *Lenda Sustentável*) based on their XP.
* **Monthly Challenges:** Interactive tasks like reducing peak-hour consumption by 10% or sharing saving tips to earn bonus XP.
* **Sustainability Tracking:** Real-time calculation of CO₂ emissions avoided based on consumption habits.
* **Reward System:** Automated conversion of XP into 5€ invoice discounts.
* **Local State Management:** Full data persistence using the browser's `localStorage`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables, Flexbox/Grid)
* **Logic & State:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Architecture:** Component-free, lightweight DOM manipulation

## 💡 What I Learned
Building this within a strict 6:30-hour deadline taught me how to prioritize the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). I focused on delivering a flawless, interactive UI that clearly demonstrated the business value to the Goldenergy mentors, using pure web technologies to ensure rapid development and zero dependencies.
